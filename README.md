## Tips
1.	While leveling up, consider focusing on the main mission and events you might run into while exploring the world – wait for level 30 when you have specializations unlocked before doing side missions because they scale to your level and provide a considerable experience boost to your spec points and field caches (which you will want a lot of after unlocking world tiers). Side missions also give you 33% of a level so it’s best to do them when you have at least 33% XP left to gain a level.
2.	One of the best perks to unlock right after unlocking your second weapon slot, is the accolade perks which gives you XP for various actions which add up to a significant bonus while leveling.
3.	Utilize the cover system by moving from cover to cover, this helps drastically reduce the amount of damage taken – you can from cover to cover while reloading, and you dodge roll halfway through your clip. Swapping guns can also be done during the last half of the reload animation without canceling the reload.
4.	Want your character to move around corners faster while in cover? Change the default setting from ‘slow’ to ‘fast.’ Escape > Settings > Controls: toggle "Move Around Corner Speed" to 'Fast' instead of the default 'slow'.
5.	Hold 'Shift' while climbing down a ladder to slide faster to the bottom.
6.	You may be able to donate items to some of your current projects using the map without having to revisit a settlement (though rewards may still require revisit).
7.	You can enable “grid view” in your inventory. Check the “options” action on the bottom right of the inventory screen.
8.	When playing with a group, don’t run ahead and shoot into a large group of enemies just to start taking out one at a time. The rest of the enemies will spread out, take cover and start a team assault before your team is ready for it. Keep in mind that groups of enemies can be crowd controlled and eliminated using area of effect damage, which makes it much easier, quicker, and safer for your group to dispatch enemies when you work as a team.
9.	Consider tagging your enemies by placing your crosshairs directly over them for a brief period. This makes them much easier to track under fire. A small triangle appears below their health bar, which is visible to all team mates, and will be the color of the enemy type (red, purple, yellow), and will remain visible when the enemies are behind cover.
10.	Specializations are unlocked by completing all 3 strongholds.
11.	SHD caches are often hidden behind a locked door, which can be unlocked by shooting the lock off on the other side of the door which may simply require repositioning to gain line of sight. Sometimes it’s hidden in a room or building that can be accessed by simply opening the door (even garage/warehouse doors).
12.	Fast travel locations include completed missions, dark zone checkpoints, friendly control points, settlements, and agents in your group.
13.	It is much easier/faster to navigate menus using your keyboard than using your mouse.
14.	You can disable other agents “Backup Requests” by opening the SHD tab of your map and looking at the bottom left of the screen to toggle this function on/off.
15.	[The Division 2 out-of-game map](https://division2map.com/) contains many useful filters, such as the location of Airdrops (Orange Crates).
16.	Dismantle (or cancel) your skills, such as the Incinerator Turret or Drones which can be toggled on an off, as this drastically improves the skills uptime for when you actually need it.
17.	For fast control point clears, clear the control point first (but do NOT use the signal flare yet), then clear the attached activities, and then return to the control point, use your flare and ‘complete’ the control point.
18.	The crafting table can be upgraded, which might be easily overlooked while you are leveling up. It’s a menu option at the bottom of the crafting table window when available.
19.	Progression info in the menu has a LOT of information in it, be sure to check the different tabs available within. There are commendation rewards to claim if you have completed any that will not be awarded to you otherwise.
20.	The control point resources buff can be obtained if the resources are all at 50 or above. If they are already at 50, you do not need to donate anymore as just visiting the Control Point Officer gives you the buff.
21.	Vaulting is quicker if you leave cover first.
22.	Control point loot resets daily.
23.	Press “back” (‘Esc’ for PC) to avoid turning away from the crafting table each time an item is crafted.
24.	[DZ level 10+ offers you free daily loot](https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/b3vng4/get_your_dark_zone_level_to_at_least_level_10_as/)
25.	What to do with all the loot while leveling? While starting out, it’s best to deconstruct most of the gear that you don’t want to keep. While you will need a minimal amount for crafting, you’ll need a lot of resources to craft so it’s best to stock up on those and cap out some of your resources. Then as your approach the higher levels, your gear will sell for money cash and you’ll end up capped on many of your basic resources.
26.	How to get Blueprints? Raise an enemy control point to alert level 3 and then take over the control point to be awarded a blueprint.
